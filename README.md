# About
This project was developed to create a more efficient solution for determining the value of used cars. Inspired by my father's experience as a car salesman, I recognized the need for an application that could automatically appraise vehicles, streamlining the process and providing accurate estimates quickly.

# Features
### Overview
Auto ApprAIsal is a sophisticated web application designed to simplify the process of determining the value of your used car. Leveraging advanced machine learning models trained on extensive datasets, Auto ApprAIsal provides quick and accurate car valuations. Simply provide the make, model, year, and mileage of your vehicle, and our system will deliver an appraisal in seconds.

- From here, users can add information about their car that the machine learning model will use to make a prediction on the car's value.
- Users can select from a plethora of car makes and their respective models. 

# The Results

- The model predicts the car's value with 86% accuracy, demonstrating a strong alignment between its predictions and the actual values based on the training data.

# Project Use
- This project is a non-profit free to use website meant to help the martial arts community. It was shared with practitioners online and fellow training partners at my local gym.
- With 50+ registered users, practitioners consistently praise the website for its usefulness in visualizing their progress and enhancing their learning experience.

# Future Development
- This is my first startup, and I am planning on updating the website based on user feedback as well as expanding it to other martial art disciplines.
