# About
This project was developed to create a more efficient solution for determining the value of used cars. Inspired by my father's experience as a car salesman, I recognized the need for an application that could automatically appraise vehicles, streamlining the process and providing accurate estimates quickly.

# Features
### Overview
Auto ApprAIsal is a sophisticated web application designed to simplify the process of determining the value of your used car. Leveraging advanced machine learning models trained on extensive datasets, Auto ApprAIsal provides quick and accurate car valuations. Simply provide the make, model, year, and mileage of your vehicle, and our system will deliver an appraisal in seconds.

- From here, users can add a session, view their sessions, or look at their session data analytics.
- Users also get to view their total training time, sparring time, and total days training.

# Add Session

- Users are able to add important information from their training sessions, such as what discipline they trained in, how long it was, what techniques they used, how long they sparred, and what day they did it.

# Graph and Chart Data of Progress

- The bar graph shows users their training hours over a span of dates.
- The pie chart shows the user the number of hours they trained each discipline.
- This vizualization aids users in their journey as they get to see how many hours they are training each day and what disciplines they should prioritize for balance.

# Sessions

- An overview of all user session data is laid out and organized by date.

- Users can select a discipline pick from a plethora of in-depth technique breakdown videos explained by professional and experienced martial artists.
- This gives the user an opportunity to train, practice, and learn outside of the gym, elevating their game for next time they come to training.

# Project Use
- This project is a non-profit free to use website meant to help the martial arts community. It was shared with practitioners online and fellow training partners at my local gym.
- With 50+ registered users, practitioners consistently praise the website for its usefulness in visualizing their progress and enhancing their learning experience.

# Future Development
- This is my first startup, and I am planning on updating the website based on user feedback as well as expanding it to other martial art disciplines.
